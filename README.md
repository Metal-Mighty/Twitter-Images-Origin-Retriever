# Twitter Images Origin Retriever
Retrieves the original image file from a Tweet or an image hosted by Twitter

This script only works on specific statuses, but will also redirect to the original Twitter file if the user opens the image directly in their browser.

Disclaimer: I am a complete newbie at Javascript and I put this together very quickly. It has some dirty algorithms that should be redone in the future, such as the monitoring of the whole page until the images appear, and the use of predetermined classes that can be changed by Twitter at any time (the last website version ain't making it any easier either to be honest...)

This script is inspired by and uses parts of this UserScript https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/9510-twitter-image-orig-promoter
